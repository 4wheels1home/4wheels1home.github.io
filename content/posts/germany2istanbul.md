In July 2021 I started to travel from Schalksm√ºhle, Germany to Istanbul. After my first on-site work week since February 2020 in Frankfurt and an awesome weekend with my friends in Karlsruhe, I drove south to Bavaria. My journey took me through Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria before arriving in Istanbul. There I'd meet up with my family to spend a week in our house, before continuing to the south of Turkey.
